<h3>Kalokalo</h3>

<p>On new Kalokalo, the tribe feels good since they have a lot of strong people like Brad, Michaela, Domenick and Ozzy. But everybody on the tribe agrees that if they somehow lose, Ben is going home for two reasons: he is the biggest threat and is the only one on the tribe who wasn’t on original Taleitaki. Ben knows he is being targeted, but he still has an idol, so if worst comes to worst he can play it to save himself. Domenick is happy that he got swapped with Brad, his number one ally. However, Michaela got swapped away from her two allies, Cirie and Cydney and is now scared for their positions in the game. Even though David is on the tribe, who was in the Millennials vs Gen X alliance, that was never a strong alliance and Michaela is not close to David anyways.</p>


<h3>Taleitaki</h3>

<p>On new Taleitaki, Hannah and Cirie are the only ones from old Taleitaki, and are most likely on the bottom. However, the old Kalokalo’s like Hannah and Cirie and aren’t targeting them just yet. Tony and Jason are still together, and they are close, even though Tony is closer with Ben. However, despite Tony having the numbers and a really close ally, he is still really paranoid that he will be targeted. Aubry and Spencer are still together, and despite them not voting with each other last vote, Aubry still convinced Spencer to flip and vote Tony. The two still feel good with each other and want to continue working with each other.</p>


<h3>Yavusa Tolu</h3>

<p>The brand new tribe, Yavusa Tola is in a interesting position because 3 members are from old Kalokalo and 3 members are from old Taleitaki. Adam gets paranoid, since he is the only winner on the tribe and the biggest threat - but he still has Jay, who is his biggest ally. Jay had a friendly rivalry with Adam last time, but since then they have become really close friends, and Jay is willing to do anything to save Adam from being the target. Christian and Devon are happy to be together; after all the chaos on old Kalokalo, they grew closer, as they were the only ones they could trust since everybody else kept flipping and doing other crazy stuff. Cydney is worried - not only was she separated from her allies, she is now on a tribe with Scot, who Cydney betrayed in Kaoh Rong. Scot is still mad about that and wants to get Cydney out as soon as possible. Everybody can feel the tension between them, making camp life really uncomfortable.</p>
