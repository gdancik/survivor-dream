<h2 id = "day6-status">Tribe Statuses </h2>

<h3>Kalokalo</h3>

<p>On new Kalokalo, the tribe feels good since they have a lot of strong people like Brad, Michaela, Domenick and Ozzy. But everybody on the tribe agrees that if they somehow lose, Ben is going home for two reasons: he is the biggest threat and is the only one on the tribe who wasn’t on original Taleitaki. Ben knows he is being targeted, but he still has an idol, so if worst comes to worst he can play it to save himself. Domenick is happy that he got swapped with Brad, his number one ally. However, Michaela got swapped away from her two allies, Cirie and Cydney and is now scared for their positions in the game. Even though David is on the tribe, who was in the Millennials vs Gen X alliance, that was never a strong alliance and Michaela is not close to David anyways.</p>


<h3>Taleitaki</h3>

<p>On new Taleitaki, Hannah and Cirie are the only ones from old Taleitaki, and are most likely on the bottom. However, the old Kalokalo’s like Hannah and Cirie and aren’t targeting them just yet. Tony and Jason are still together, and they are close, even though Tony is closer with Ben. However, despite Tony having the numbers and a really close ally, he is still really paranoid that he will be targeted. Aubry and Spencer are still together, and despite them not voting with each other last vote, Aubry still convinced Spencer to flip and vote Tony. The two still feel good with each other and want to continue working with each other.</p>


<h3>Yavusa Tolu</h3>

<p>The brand new tribe, Yavusa Tola is in a interesting position because 3 members are from old Kalokalo and 3 members are from old Taleitaki. Adam gets paranoid, since he is the only winner on the tribe and the biggest threat - but he still has Jay, who is his biggest ally. Jay had a friendly rivalry with Adam last time, but since then they have become really close friends, and Jay is willing to do anything to save Adam from being the target. Christian and Devon are happy to be together; after all the chaos on old Kalokalo, they grew closer, as they were the only ones they could trust since everybody else kept flipping and doing other crazy stuff. Cydney is worried - not only was she separated from her allies, she is now on a tribe with Scot, who Cydney betrayed in Kaoh Rong. Scot is still mad about that and wants to get Cydney out as soon as possible. Everybody can feel the tension between them, making camp life really uncomfortable.</p>



<h2 id = "day6-immunity">Immunity Challenge </h2>

<p>Kalokalo and Yavusa Tolu have won immunity, so Taleitaki is going to tribal!</p>


<h2 id = "day6-status-2"> Status</h2>

<p>Taleitaki is sad to go to tribal, since they are pretty close and don’t want to vote anyone out. However, the four Kalokalos decide to just vote out Cirie since she is weaker in challenges. However, Cirie knows she is being targeted, and since last time she got eliminated since she didn’t have an advantage, she decides to go on an idol hunt. It doesn’t take long for everybody to realize what she is doing, and suddenly the majority gets worried and everybody starts looking for idols! It goes for hours of everybody scrambling, but eventually… Spencer finds it! He tells Aubry, and they both are super happy! They could potentially flip the game now, since they never really wanted to work with Jason and Tony anyways. Eventually everybody stops looking for idols, and Cirie and Hannah are really worried, but Aubry and Spencer come with them to the plan to flip on Jason and Tony. Tony and Jason still want to vote Cirie, but want to split it between Cirie and Hannah in case one of them has an idol. Spencer and Aubry are the swing vote here, and their decision could change the rest of the game. </p>


<h2 id = "day6-tribal"> Tribal Council </h2>

<p> I'll go tally the votes. If anyone has a hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so. </p>

<p> Alright, I'll read the votes. </p>

<p> First vote...Tony. </p>

<p> Tony. That's two votes Tony. </p>

<p> Jason. </p>

<p> Jason. That's two votes Tony, two votes Jason. </p>

<p> Hannah. That's two votes Tony, two votes Jason, one vote Hannah, one vote left. </p>

<p> Hannah. We're tied. </p>

<p> This season has a twist: instead of the usual revote, we will go straight to rocks (because I'm too lazy to make a revote poll lol.) Per the rules of Survivor, if the vote is a deadlock, we draw rocks. Tony, Jason, and Hannah now become safe. Cire, Aubry, and Spencer must now draw rocks. Two of the rocks are white, one is black. Whoever draws the black rock is eliminated from the game. </p>

<p> Alright, everybody reveal. </p>

<p> The person who draws the black rock is........ </p> </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>

<p>Spencer.</p>
<p>Spencer, tonight I think it is more appropriate tonight to say that the game has spoken.</p>
