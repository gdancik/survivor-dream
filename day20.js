<p>Adam has won immunity!!!</p>

<p> Adam is super happy to have won immunity and know that he will we last until the final six! With him winning immunity, Hannah and David can't vote for him anymore, and Domenick realizes this and tries to convince them to vote Christian with him. Christian is a very big social threat, but he is also strategic, even finding an idol. However, Christian tries to get them to take out Domenick, since he is such a big strategic threat. Meanwhile, Adam still wants to get out Hannah and David and tries to convince a bunch of people to take them out. But Hannah realizes this and tries to think of a plan. She goes to Domenick and Christian to convince them to team up for a blindside on either Cirie or Brad. Cirie is the only left who hasn't really pissed anyone off, and she will definitely win in the end because she is Cirie - this is her fifth time playing! And also, Domenick and Christians fights both make them look bad in front of the jury. The two know it is a good plan, and consider it. </p>
