<h2 id = "day3-immunity">Immunity Challenge </h2>
Taleitaki has won immunity, which means Kalokalo is going to tribal!


<h2 id = "day3-status"> Kalokalo status</h2>

<p>Kalokalo is sad to have lost, since everybody likes each other and doesn’t want to vote anybody out. However, Spencer, Jason, Aubry, Scot, Devon, Zeke, Tai, and Christian decide that either Ben or Tony need to be voted out, and will split the vote between them. Ben and Tony start scrambling and Ben goes on an idol hunt. He searches for a while, until he see something by a tree stump…it’s the idol! Ben is joyous to have found it, and tells Tony immediately. However, Ben wants to save it so him and Tony do some work to try to change the vote. They start talking to Jason, proposes a plan to vote out Tai, since they know Jason has bad memories with Tai. Jason tells Scot, who is also a fan of the idea. However, Zeke heres them talking about voting out Tai, and runs and tells Tai he might be in trouble. Tai gets paranoid and starts trying to find an idol, unaware that Ben already has it. He then starts attempting to get the numbers attempting to flip on Jason and Scot by voting Scot out. </p>

<p>With tons of targets, this is bound to be an interesting first vote.</p>

<h2 id = "day3-tribal"> Tribal Council </h2>

<p>
 Jeff: Behind each of you is a torch. Go ahead and grab a torch and approach the flame. Dip it in and get fire. This is a part of the ritual of tribal council, because in this game, fire represents life. As long as you have fire, you are still in this game. When your fire's gone, so are you.
</p>

<p>
Short recap:
</p>

<p>The majority 8 planned to split the vote between Tony and Ben, the two winners and biggest threats on the tribe. However, Ben found an idol, which means, if played correctly, could save them. They tried to convince Jason and Scot to vote Tai since they have bad experiences with him. However, Zeke overheard this conversation, and told Tai, who then targeted Scot.
With so many targets, it is bound to be a crazy tribal council.
Alright, it is time to vote.</p>

<h3>Kalokalo</h3>

<p>After getting back from tribal council, Tony and Ben are super happy that there plan worked, and that they now have Jason, Scot, and Spencer on their side. They went from the bottom to in the majority alliance - now all they have to do is stick together and pick off everybody else one by one. Christian, Zeke, Devon, and Aubry were blindsided by the last vote and they are now on the bottom. However, Zeke is willing to vote with the majority alliance at any time. He likes to play this game hard, and he is willing to do whatever it takes to get out of the minority. Zeke immediately starts talking to other alliance, and Christian, Devon and Aubry realize that he is not going to work with them moving forward. After Spencer flipped, he feels good about his position in the game. He wants to work with Tony, Ben, Jason, and Scot as meat sheilds. That way he won't be targeted as much. However, he is willing to flip at any time.</p>

<h3>Taleitaki Recap</h3>

<p>Taleitaki didn't go to tribal and nothing changed, so this will be a short recap.
On Taleitaki, Domenick found the legacy advantage, granting him safety at either the final 12 or final 6. His plan is to work more on his social game this time around, and makes a strong alliance with Brad. Meanwhile, Cirie, Michaela and Cydney formed a strong trio. Adam got paranoid and started to get a majority of everybody from Millennials vs Gen X. However, Michaela does not want to work with Jay (who is in the alliance) after he blindsided her last time, and David and Hannah don't trust Adam and plan to flip on him. However, Adam and Jay have a strong bond, and want to work with each other for the rest of the game.</p>
