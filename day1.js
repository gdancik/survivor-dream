<h2 id = "day1-status"> Tribe Status </h2>

<h3> Kalokalo status </h3>

<p>On Kalokalo, everybody is super excited to be brought back and have a chance to play again! Although the tribe seems unified on the surface, strategy talk starts immediately. Scot and Jason, who worked together on Kaoh Rong, decide to work together, but try to hide it from everybody else so they are not targeted. They lay low and work on the shelter. Devon is excited to play again, especially since last time he was one fire making challenge away from a million dollars. He immediately starts making bonds with everybody, and forms a strong alliance with Spencer, Aubry, Zeke, and Christian. Christian is also very happy to be back! He decides to be the same person as last time, but downplay his threat level. That way people will like him and want to keep him around, but hopefully they won’t consider him a threat and won’t vote him out. Tony is aware he is the biggest threat there, as a two time winner. His strategy is to lay super low for the first few stages of the game, but he knows he is going to have to work hard if he has any chance of staying around. He quickly forms an alliance with Ben, the only other winner on the tribe. They decide they have to find an idol to stay in the game, so they sneak off to “get water”, and look for it. The other 8 tribe members quickly realize what they are doing, and decide that if they go to tribal, they should just split the votes between Tony and Ben to make it easy. </p>

<h3>Taleitaki</h3>

<p>As soon as Taleitaki gets to camp, Ozzy becomes Ozzy and starts building the shelter, finding food, and other Ozzy things. Domenick found the legacy advantage in the marooning, but doesn’t trust anybody and doesn’t tell anyone about it. He wants to work more on his social game this time, since that is what caused him to lose last time, so he makes a strong alliance with Brad. Cirie and Michaela reform the alliance they had in Game Changers, and add Cydney to it. Since nobody suspects this threesome, they think they might have a chance to go to final three together. Meanwhile, Adam is scared since he is a winner, so he quickly gathers a big alliance of Jay, Hannah, Michaela, and David, who all competed on Millennials vs Gen X. However, Michaela does not trust Jay at all after he blindsided her in Millennials vs Gen X, and does not plan to work with the alliance. David and Hannah also become weary of Adam, and don’t really trust him. They decide that if they go to tribal, they should flip on the MvG alliance and gather the numbers to get rid of Adam. However, Adam and Jay have a strong alliance and Jay does not plan on flipping on Adam anytime soon.</p>
