<h2 id = "day23-immunity">Immunity Challenge </h2>

<p> Alright, let's get to todays immunity challenge. But first - there is a twist. Tonight, there will not be a regular tribal council. Instead, the jury will vote on who goes home. Big stakes tonight, so lets get to the immunity challenge.</p>

<p>This immunity Challenge is called Vertigo. For this challenge, you start on a tall perch where you will have to gather water with a bucket and a long rope. The water must be poured in a chute, which causes a pole with a key at the top to rise. Once you are able to reach the key, you must go to the shore and work on a puzzle. First person to finish the puzzle wins immunity.
Big stakes, lets get to it.</p>

<p> Domenick has won immunity!  </p>
