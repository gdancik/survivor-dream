<p> Today's immunity challenge is called Get a Grip. You must hang on to a pole for as long as you can. When you drop, you are out of the challenge. Last person standing wins. </p>

<p>Michaela has won immunity!</p>

<h3 id = "day17-status2">  STATUS </h3>

<p>After the last vote, Aubry, Domenick, and Christian voted together and took power of the game. However, they still have work to do. Jason still wants to get out Aubry or Domenick, and starts trying to rally the troops against them. Brad feels betrayed from the last vote after Domenick flipped on him and joins Jason to try to take them out. With Jason targeting them, Domenick, Aubry, and Christian target Jason and try to get numbers on their side. Meanwhile, the Millennials vs Gen X alliance is still in disarray. Adam still wants to get them out, especially after they voted him last tribal. Hannah and David are still targeting Adam also. </p>


<p>With everybody having a different idea, it might be crazy. </p>
