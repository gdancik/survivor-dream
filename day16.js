<h2 id = "day16-status"> Merge Tribe Status </h2>

<p>Everybody is happy to be merged! However, so many people have not even gone to tribal yet and are excited to play, so strategy starts immediately. 
Out of the eight people voted out pre-merge, seven of them were from Kalokalo. The only people left are Aubry, Christian, and Jason. However, Jason does not want to work with Aubry and Christian. Aubry and Christian know they have to work together if they want to stay in the game, so Aubry hopes to use her relationship with Cirie and Hannah from the swapped Taleitaki tribe. Cirie and Michaela are super happy to be back together, even though they lost Cydney. They plan to still play under the radar, but hopefully they control the game from behind the scenes. Meanwhile, Adam is more paranoid then ever. He is happy to make the merge, but as the only winner on a twelve person tribe, he knows he will be a target. He checks back with his Millennials vs Gen X alliance, of himself, Jay, Hannah, and David. However, David and Hannah still want to flip on him, but try to convince Adam that they are still with him. Domenick has the legacy advantage, which can be used this round, but he hopes to keep it to final six. He is still working on his social game, and he's been growing his bond with Brad everyday. But he realizes that there are only really three physical threats on the tribe: himself, Brad, and Ozzy. This might cause them to be targeted early. So Domenick decides to bring Ozzy into his alliance and use him as a meat sheild in case people try to target the physical threats. </p>
