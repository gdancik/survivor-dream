<h2 id = "day14-immunity">Immunity Challenge </h2>

<p>Taleitaki and Kalokalo have won, so Yavusa Tolu is going to tribal.</p>

<h2 id = "day14-status"> Status </h2>

<p>Yavusa Tolu is super bummed to have lost, and all three of them are tired of going to tribal. All of them also realize that everybody else is a threat. Despite, Christian and Aubry going against Ben for the whole game, they still really like him as a person and don't really want to vote him out.</p>

<h2 id = "day14-tribal"> Tribal Council </h2>

<h3> Results </h3>

<p> I'll go tally the votes. </p>

<p> If anyone has a hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so. Alright, I'll read the votes. </p>

<p> First vote...Ben. </p>

<p> Aubry. One vote Ben, one vote Aubry, one vote left. </p>

<p> Eighth person voted out of Survivor: Dream All Stars and first member of the jury....Ben (he will be a jury member since there is a final two and if we have a ten person jury and there is a tie I wouldn't know what to do...So we'll have eleven jury members to prevent that) </p>
