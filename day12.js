<h2 id = "day12-events">Tribe Swap </h2>


<p>Everybody, drop your buffs. We're switching tribes again.</p>

<p>Here are the new tribes.</p>

<h3>KALOKALO</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Michaela</li>
    <li>Cirie</li>
    <li>Jason</li>
   <li> Jay</li>
    <li>David</li>
</ol>

<h3>TALEITAKI</h3>
<ol>
   <li> Ozzy</li>
    <li>Brad</li>
    <li>Adam</li>
    <li>Hannah</li>
    <li>Domenick</li>
</ol>
<h3>Yavusa Tolu</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Aubry</li>
    <li>Ben</li>
    <li>Devon</li>
    <li>Christian</li>
</ol>

<p>Wait - there is a twist. Yavusa Tolu, you must go immediately to Tribal. No time to talk.</p>


<h2 id = "day12-tribal"> Tribal Council </h2>

<h3> Results </h3>

<p> I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so. </p>

<p> Ben: You know what, Jeff, these people have been targeting me from the start of the game. I think tonight will be the same. </p>

<p> This is a hidden immunity idol. Any votes cast against Ben will not count. I'll read the votes. </p>

<p> First vote...Ben. Does not count. </p>

<p> Ben. Does not count. </p>

<p> Aubry. </p>

<p> Final vote... Christian. </p>

<p> Here is how this is going to work. In this season, we go immediately to rocks. This would mean the two people in the tie would be safe, and everybody else would have to draw rocks. However, since Ben played an idol he is safe. Aubry and Christian are in the tie so they are safe. Which means Devon, you are eliminated by default. </p>
<p> Devon, you threw away your vote on Christian just like you did to Mike at the final five of Survivor: Heroes vs Healers vs Hustlers. That time it saved you from elimination. This time, you got yourself eliminated. Devon, the tribe has spoken. </p>
