<p>Adam has won immunity for group one, and Domenick has won immunity for group two.</p>

<h3 id = "day18-status">  STATUS </h3>

<h3>GROUP ONE STATUS</h3>

<p>On group one, four people are from Millennials vs Gen X, and only one is not - Brad. However, that doesn't really matter since Michaela was not working with them anyways and Hannah wants to get out Adam. Since Adam won immunity, she decides to instead take a shot at Jay, Adam's partner. That way he will have a lot less power going forward. So Hannah tries to convince Michaela and Brad to vote with her. Adam and Jay want to get out Hannah, since she's been targeting them for basically every round. Michaela wants to work with them since they are always the target and might help vote with them out of paranoia. So she joins the plan to get out Hannah. Hannah realizes this, and then realizes something about Michaela. Michaela has been controlling the game so far. She is never a target, and has always voted correctly post-merge. Nobody else realizes this, but if Michaela keeps during this and gets to the end, she will win. So she goes to Adam and Jay to try to convince them to vote Michaela. Adam and Jay aren't too sure if Hannah's telling the truth, but like the idea and consider it.</p>

<h3>GROUP TWO STATUS</h3>

<p>Group two has Domenick, Aubry and Christian still together, who at this point are a power trio. The three like Cirie, so instead they want to take out David, who is a big threat. David knows this, so he goes to Domenick to try to convince him to flip on Aubry, since she is such a big threat. Then he goes to Aubry to try to convince her to flip on Christian. Domenick then goes to Christian to tell him to plan to flip on Aubry, but Christian doesn't want to do that so he goes to tell Aubry. He and Aubry are really close and he doesn't want to betray her. So he plans to use the idol on her if he gets a bad vibe at tribal. Aubry and Christian are both now mad at Domenick, and now the group is completely fractured. David hopes that his plan worked and hopefully he will be spared.</p>
